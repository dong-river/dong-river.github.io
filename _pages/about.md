I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the University of Cambridge, specializing in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs). I am supervised by Professor [Nigel Collier](https://sites.google.com/site/nhcollier/home) and advised by [Dr. Ivan Vulic](https://sites.google.com/site/ivanvulic/). My current research focuses on developing Personalized LLM Assistants through personalized alignment, interactive learning, and agents.

(1) Personalized Alignment: Steering models to align with diverse global users. [ [PersonalizedJudge](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-emnlp.592.pdf) ] [ [Benchmark](https://aclanthology.org/2025.coling-main.752.pdf) ]  
(2) Collaborative Agents: Training models to better interact and collaborate with humans, including agents that ask clarification questions at appropriate times and collaborate with users with different knowledge levels.  
(3) Learning from User Feedback: Mining and leveraging explicit and implicit, naturally occurring user feedback (critiques, preferences, edits) to further align the model to a specific task or user at deployment time.

Previously, I earned my undergraduate and master’s degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, where I was advised by Professor [Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/). I have also interned at Amazon, Roblox, and Sequoia Capital.
