I am a third-year NLP Ph.D. student at the University of Cambridge, [Language Technology Lab (LTL)](https://ltl.mmll.cam.ac.uk). I am supervised by Professor [Nigel Collier](https://sites.google.com/site/nhcollier/home) and advised by [Dr. Ivan Vulic](https://sites.google.com/site/ivanvulic/). My current research focuses on developing Personalized LLM Assistants through studying personalized alignment, collaborative agents, and online user feedback. 

**(1) Personalized Alignment:** Aligning models with diverse global users through personalized preference learning, reward modeling, and subjective reasoning. \\
**(2) Collaborative Agents:** Training models to better interact and collaborate with humans, including agents that ask clarification questions at appropriate times and collaborate with users with different expertise.  \\
**(3) Learning from User Feedback:** Leveraging naturally occurring explicit and implicit feedback (critiques, preferences, edits) to continually adapt models to specific users and tasks at deployment.

Previously, I earned my undergraduate and master’s degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, where I was advised by Professor [Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/). I have also interned at Amazon, Roblox, and Sequoia Capital.
