I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the University of Cambridge, specializing in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs). I am supervised by Professor [Nigel Collier](https://sites.google.com/site/nhcollier/home) and advised by [Dr. Ivan Vulic](https://sites.google.com/site/ivanvulic/). My current research focuses on developing Personalized LLM Assistants through personalized alignment, interactive learning, and agents.

Previously, I earned my undergraduate and master’s degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, where I was advised by [Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/). I have also interned at Amazon, Roblox, and Sequoia Capital.

 <!-- senior at University of Pennsylvania studying Mathematics and Data Science. My primary research interest is incorporating knowledge and reasoning into natural language generation(NLG).  -->
<!-- I am excited about enhancing NLG's factuality, logical coherence and explainability by adding in knowledge base and world model. -->

<!-- <!-- I worked on creating new evaluation framework for NLG with Professor [Lyle Ungar](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~ungar/)   and [Joao Sedoc](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/bio/joao-sedoc). -->
