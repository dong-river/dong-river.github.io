I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the University of Cambridge, specializing in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs). I am supervised by Professor [Nigel Collier](https://sites.google.com/site/nhcollier/home) and advised by [Dr. Ivan Vulic](https://sites.google.com/site/ivanvulic/). My current research focuses is developing Personalized LLM Assistants through personalized alignment, interactive learning, and agents.

(1) Personalized Alignment: Steering model to align with diverse global users. [PersonalizedJudge] [Benchmark]
(2) Collaborative Agents: Training models to better interact and collaborate with human. Including agents asking clarification questions at approporiate time, and collaborate with users with different knowledge level.
(3) Learning from User Feedback: Minig and leveraging explicit and implicit natrually occuring user feedback (critiques, preferences, edits) to further align the model to a specific task or user at deploy time.

Previously, I earned my undergraduate and master’s degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, where I was advised by Professor [Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/). I have also interned at Amazon, Roblox, and Sequoia Capital.
